# Languages?
Well, I have used <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and a bit of <b>JavaScript</b> to make this website.
<div align="center">
<a href="https://github.com/Infroid-Coder/Merry-Christmas#html"><img src="https://shields.io/badge/ðŸ“™-HTML-orange"></a>
<a href="https://github.com/Infroid-Coder/Merry-Christmas#css"><img src="https://shields.io/badge/ðŸ“˜-CSS-blue"></a>
<a href="https://github.com/Infroid-Coder/Merry-Christmas#javascript"><img src="https://shields.io/badge/ðŸ“—-JavaScript-green"></a>
</div>

## HTML
HTML is the main root of this website.
<br>But according to <b>Github</b>, 
I have used it secondly the mostðŸ˜….<br>In percentage, <b>30.4%</b>. Anyway that's all about HTML.<br>Let's move on to CSS.

## CSS
Well as I said in the <b>HTML</b> section, it's the secondly most used one.
<br>And CSS is the mostly used one. Probably it should be. Because in this website, I used CSS much more than HTML.
<br>Because I just had to attach some images and add the text in HTML. And I had style all of it with CSS. 
<br>So probably yes, CSS must be the used the mostly.

## JavaScript
About JavaScript, I used it only for 1 function.
<br>The function that should be executed once the play button is clicked.
<br>That's all I have done with JS.
